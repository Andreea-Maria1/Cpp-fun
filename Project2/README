Question 1

ABC Group is doing research on the Vehicle Fuel Consumption Value (VFCV). In the first step,
VFCV data of 20 vehicles is collected (which are integers between 5 and 25 inclusive). In the
second step, statistical information is generated based on the following criteria:
a) The number of vehicles which have the VFCV equals to each integer in the range of 5 and
25 (Each output reflects the total number of vehicles with the same VFCV).
b) The number of vehicles which have the VFCV above each integer in the range of 5 and 25.
c) The VFCV collected by the maximum number of vehicles.
d) The highest VFCV which belongs to no vehicle.
Note 1: You need to define a separate function for each part (a,b,c, and d).
Here is the name of the functions:
 getEachVFCV (for part a)
 getAboveVFCV (for part b)
 maxNumVehiclesVFCV (for part c)
 highestVFCVnoVehicle (for part d)
Note 2: You can define and use other functions as well if you wish.
Note 3: You need to use an array data structure to store the VFCVs.
Here is a sample array:
(It can be initialized inside the body of your source code without prompting user)
int VFCV[20] ={8,12,13,15,15,15,10,9,9,10,25,18,7,6,5,10,24,10,11,12};
Here is a sample output screen to illustrate the expected behaviour of your program.
